PredixMobileUIKit (Beta)
====

The PredixUIKit is a framework desinged to make building UI applications for [Predix](https://predix.io) simple by providing a rich set of data visualization components that follow [Predix Design System](https://www.predix-ui.com/#/develop/mobile) guidelines and common components meant to speed development when used with the [Predix SDK for iOS](https://github.com/predixdev/predixsdkforios). 

PredixUIKit is not a port of the Predix Design System and does not override or change stock iOS UI elements.  It is intended to enhance applications that use the Predix SDK for iOS with UI Elements that adhere to the [Predix Design System](https://www.predix-ui.com/#/develop/mobile) and the [Apple HIG](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/themes/).
