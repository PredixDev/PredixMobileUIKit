PredixMobileUIKit (Alpha)
====

The PredixUIKit is a framework designed to make building UI applications for [Predix](https://predix.io) simpler with the help of a rich set of data visualization components that follow [Predix Design System](https://www.predix-ui.com/#/develop/mobile) guidelines and common components meant to accelerate development when used with the [Predix SDK for iOS](https://github.com/predixdev/predixsdkforios). 

PredixUIKit is not a part of the Predix Design System and does not override or change stock iOS UI elements.  It is intended to enhance applications that use the Predix SDK for iOS with UI elements that adhere to the Predix Design System guidelines and the [Apple HIG](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/themes/).
